# 42_netpractice

This project is a general practical exercise to let 42 students discover networking.

## Description

The learner has to configure small-scale networks. Ranging over 10 levels with increasing difficulty, more and more concepts are introduced, like IP adresses, subnet masks, networks, subnetworks, switches and routers.

## Learnings

My first intro to networking in general. Next to some of the basic principles and buzz words of networking (like ISO/OSI Modell, TCP/IP, IPv4, IPv6,...) I specifically learned a lot about subnetting and how to distribute IP numbers among different subnets.
